I am currently a PhD student of Cynthia Dwork in Harvard's [Theory of Computation](https://toc.seas.harvard.edu) group. I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, with a focus on differential privacy and algorithmic fairness.

In 2021, I graduated _summa cum laude_ (top 5% of class) from Harvard College with an AB in Computer Science and Mathematics and an SM in Computer Science. I was on the [competitive programming team](https://cphof.org/profile/codeforces:pbt17).

I grew up in Cary, North Carolina and [play the piano](https://youtu.be/u_9iX6jMtzU) in my free time.
